\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Prof Weikum for exactly right amount of supervision, insightful meetings and overall total support whatsoever.

I would like to thank Andrew Yates for being there at all times: suggesting great (and not so) things to experiment with and help to sort out any kind of problems.

I want to thank Paramita Mirza for sharing her expertise and being able to sort out things which crush at the last minute. Her advice in writing and web programming is invaluable.

Overall thanks to D5 colleagues, thanks to my numerous room mates.
