\droppedcapital{I}{n} this chapter we cover the necessary background for our work on predicting personal information from conversations. In Section \ref{back_rel} we discuss previous studies, giving a brief overview of the methods for inferring personal attributes and interpersonal relationships in transcribed dialogues and social media submissions. In Section \ref{back_meth} we provide theoretical details for the approaches used in our work: background on deep learning for natural language processing and model evaluation criteria.
