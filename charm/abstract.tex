\droppedcapital{P}ersonal knowledge about users' professions, hobbies, favorite food, and travel preferences, among others,
is a valuable asset for individualized AI, such as
recommenders or chatbots.
Conversations in social media are
a rich source of data for inferring 
%this kind of 
personal facts.
Prior work developed supervised %attribute 
methods to extract this knowledge, 
but these approaches
can not generalize beyond 
attribute values 
%that were seen as training labels.
with ample labeled training samples. 
Such models are thus inapplicable for the \textit{long-tailed} personal attributes, such as \textit{hobby}, when there is little chance of acquiring labeled training data for rare values.
We overcome
this limitation
by devising CHARM: a
zero-shot learning
method 
%based on reinforcement learning, 
that creatively leverages keyword extraction and document retrieval
in order to
predict attribute values 
that were never seen during training.
Experiments with 
large datasets from Reddit
show the viability of CHARM
for open-ended attributes, such as professions
and hobbies.
