interpersonal relationships of conversation interlocutors
can enrich
personal knowledge bases  
to enhance personalized search, recommenders and chatbots.
In this chapter we propose PRIDE: a
neural multi-label classifier inferring speakers' relationships from dialogues.
Compared to the general models for structured texts,
PRIDE can effectively utilize the dialogue structure additionally augmenting it with external knowledge about 
speaker features and conversation style.
Unlike 
prior works,
we 
address 
multi-label prediction of fine-grained directed relationships. Extensive experiments on datasets based on screenplays of movies and TV series show superior performance of PRIDE compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
